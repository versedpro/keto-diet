        answers: [
            "The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet. To achieve positive results, this diet has to be very low in carbohydrates, high in dietary fat and include a moderate amount of proteins. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. Ketogenic diet can cause massive reductions in blood sugar, insulin levels and help with weight loss.",
